# MC Exotic Public Repository

## What is this? Bug reports? Suggestions...?
Welcome to the MC Exotic public repository! We're dedicated to improving our game, addressing any technical issues, and valuing your feedback. We encourage players to report bugs and share suggestions that can better the game for everyone. Let's work together to enhance MC Exotic!

## Rules & Guidelines:

1. **Search Before Posting:** Before submitting a bug report or suggestion, please search the repository to ensure it hasn't been reported or suggested before. Duplicate entries will be closed.
2. **Detailed Bug Reports:** When reporting a bug, be as detailed as possible. Include:

   + A concise title that summarizes the bug.
   + Steps to reproduce the issue.
   + Expected outcome vs. what actually happened.
   + Screenshots or videos, if possible.
   + Any other relevant information (e.g., device specifications, in-game settings).
     
3. **Be Constructive:** When submitting suggestions, explain the reason behind your idea and how it would improve the game. Avoid submitting vague or broad suggestions; the more detailed, the better.
4. **Stay Respectful:** Please maintain a positive and respectful attitude when discussing bugs or suggestions. Avoid using derogatory language or making personal attacks.
5. **Stay On Topic:** Ensure that your submissions are relevant to the game. Off-topic discussions, advertisements, or spam will be removed.
6. **Label Appropriately:** If the repository uses labels, use them appropriately to categorize your report or suggestion (e.g., "bug", "suggestion").
7. **No Personal Information:** Avoid sharing personal information such as email addresses, phone numbers, or account details in your reports or suggestions.
8. **Updates on Reports:** If the development team requires more information about a bug you've reported, they may reach out in the report's comments. Check your report periodically for any updates or questions.
9. **No Bug Exploitation:** If you've found a bug that can be exploited in the game, please refrain from publicizing the exploit. Instead, reach out to the development team directly and privately.
10. **Feedback Loop:** While the development team will review all bug reports and suggestions, not all will be implemented or addressed immediately. Your patience and understanding are appreciated.
